# Nitrofin is the most sensitive substrate for beta lactamases
# The concentration of Magnesium and Calcium ions is inversely proportional to effectivity of antibiotics, the higher the concentration of Ca ions and Mg ions, the lower the effectivity of the antibiotics 
# Selective plating on media in a microaerophilic condition, incubate at 42°C for 24-48hrs
# Acquisition of a gene called MecA gene that codes for a protein called penicillin binding protein (PBP2A) 
# Electron microscopy 
# The concentration of an antibiotic decreases as it diffuses away from the disk in AST
# In indole test, substrate must contain tryptophan 
# Thayer Martin Agar is a selective media for Neisseria gonorrhoea. although it contains blood and Nad, it contains antibiotics which inhibits growth of Gram positive and other gram negatives too
# Haemophilus influenza exhibits the satellite phenomenon around staphylococcus aureus 
# Pneumonia is the infection and inflammation of the airsacs 
# Pseudomonas aeruginosa grows at 42°C which is inhibitory for other members 
# Shigella spp are urease negative, oxidase negative, non motile
